# Title

## Abstract
***A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, datasets used. What's the motivation behind your project? How do you propose to extend the analysis from the paper? What story would you like to tell, and why?***

We would like to know what features can explain the betrayal better than the politeness score. What kind of sub-features that we can extract from each set of messages can be correlated with a betrayal ? The idea would be to try several approaches, several feature engineering techniques and several methods to tackle this question.


## Research Questions

***A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.***


## Proposed dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.

## Methods
## Proposed timeline
## Organization within the team
A list of internal milestones up until project milestone P4. Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.
## Questions for TAs (optional)

***Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.***


## Ideas :

* Use several feature engineering approaches (word embedding, matrices (Irina).., combining other features, PCA)
* Try to apply Supervised Learning to classify the betrayal and see if we can get better result than the paper
* Try to apply Unsupervised Learning if we can observe to distinct classes ..??
